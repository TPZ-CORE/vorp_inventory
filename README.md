# TPZ-CORE - VORP INVENTORY BRIDGE API

The specified script has been made to support many scripts related to VORP-CORE by creating a mimic vorp_inventory and accessing the real API functions and Events. 

## SCRIPTS THAT WILL NOT BE SUPPORTED

- Character Creations
- Clothing Customizations
- Weapon Customizations (vorp is having a different way handling weapons from all frameworks). Except if the developer is using his own saving and loading methods. 
- Rols and XP
- Storage Containers (Maybe - Not exactly sure yet, but i will do my best).
